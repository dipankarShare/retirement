### 💡 3. Suggestions

#### ✅ If You Like Simplicity: Stick with VTTHX

- Good for someone retiring around 2035.  
- No rebalancing needed.  
- Low fees and broad diversification.  
- Additions/changes aren’t urgent unless you want more customization.

---

#### 🎯 If You Want More Control / Customization

**Core 3-Fund Strategy (DIY version of a Target Date Fund):**

- **US Total Stock Market** – VTSAX  
- **International Stock Market** – VTMGX or VEMAX  
- **Bond Fund** – VBILX  

**Sample Allocation:**

- 55% VTSAX  
- 25% VTMGX + VEMAX (e.g., 15% developed, 10% emerging)  
- 20% VBILX  

> More aggressive? Tilt toward small/mid caps with VSMAX/VIMAX or BUISX/DFFVX.  
> Want to hedge inflation? Add PRRIX or CSJZX in small portions.

---

#### 🔍 If You Prefer Active Management

- **Domestic Equity**: DODGX, BUISX  
- **Global Diversification**: MALOX, JNEMX  
- **Real Assets**: CSJZX, OGMIX  
- **Bonds**: PTRQX, PRRIX, BRHYX  

> These might suit someone who wants exposure beyond index funds and is okay monitoring them.

---

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- Rebalancing and monitoring are essential if you go DIY.  
- Risk tolerance matters: Closer to retirement = more bonds.  
- Avoid overlapping: Don’t hold both VTTHX and its core components (e.g., VTSAX, VBILX).

## 🔁 Option 1: Stick with VTTHX (Vanguard Target Retirement 2035)

- **Pros**: Diversified, auto-rebalanced, low-cost  
- **Cons**: Less control over allocation

> Verdict: Still suitable, but customization may provide more precision if you're comfortable.

## 🧰 Option 2: DIY Portfolio – More Customization

**Moderate Risk Allocation (60/40)**

| Asset Class             | Fund                          | % Allocation |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| U.S. Stocks             | VTSAX                         | 35%          |
| International Stocks    | VTMGX                         | 15%          |
| Emerging Markets        | VEMAX                         | 5%           |
| Bonds (Core)            | VBILX                         | 35%          |
| Inflation Protection    | PRRIX                         | 10%          |

> Total = **60% stocks / 40% bonds**, with a tilt toward inflation protection and global diversification.

---

## 🔁 Option 3: VTTHX + Small Complement

If you like VTTHX but want to add more customization:

- 80% VTTHX  
- 10% Real Assets (CSJZX – Real estate)  
- 10% Bonds (VBILX or PRRIX)

> Slightly reduces risk and adds real asset/inflation protection exposure.

---

## 🧮 Performance Note (Historical Trends)

- Target-date funds like VTTHX tend to slightly underperform DIY custom portfolios over time, but require **much less effort**.  
- Adding **real assets, TIPS, or value/small-cap** funds can improve returns and inflation hedging with modest added risk.
